<objective>
Human verifies the complete POC end-to-end: admin login, room visibility, second user registration, E2EE messaging, and branding.

Purpose: Provide final human acceptance of all VERIFY requirements. Claude automated the setup; the human confirms it works from a real browser.
Output: All Phase 3 success criteria confirmed by human observation.

  <name>Task 1: Human end-to-end verification of deployed POC</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
This is a human verification checkpoint. Claude presents the verification steps; the human performs them in a browser.

Use the Element Web URL, admin credentials, and registration token printed at the end of Plan 02.

**Step 1 — Admin Login (VERIFY-01):**
1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://<EC2-hostname>`
2. Element Web should load with the "YourBrand Chat" branding
3. Click "Sign In"
4. Enter the admin username and password from Plan 02 output
5. Confirm: you are logged in and see the Element interface

**Step 2 — Verify Rooms and Space (VERIFY-02):**
1. In the left sidebar, look for the "YourBrand Community" Space
2. Click on the Space — you should see 6 rooms listed: Lobby, Announcements, General, Support, Off Topic, Voice
3. Click into "General" or "Lobby" to confirm you can enter a room

**Step 3 — Verify Branding (VERIFY-04):**
1. Check the top-left corner — the brand name should say "YourBrand Chat" (not "Element")
2. The theme should be dark with indigo/slate colors (sidebar: dark navy, accent: indigo/purple)
3. The logo should appear in the top-left area
4. If the custom theme is not active, go to Settings > Appearance and select "YourBrand" from the theme dropdown

**Step 4 — Register Second User (VERIFY-03 setup):**
1. Open an incognito/private window OR a different browser
2. Navigate to `http://<EC2-hostname>`
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Enter the registration token from Plan 02 output
5. Choose a username (e.g., "testuser") and password
6. Complete registration

**Step 5 — E2EE Messaging (VERIFY-03):**
1. In the admin browser: go to the "General" room, click the invite button, and invite the second user by their username (e.g., `@testuser:<EC2-hostname>`)
2. In the second user's browser: accept the invite to "General"
3. Admin sends a message in "General"
4. Second user should see the message
5. Second user sends a reply
6. Admin should see the reply
7. Check for the E2EE lock icon: each message should show a small padlock icon (may require hovering over the message). Alternatively, check the room info panel — it should say "Messages in this room are end-to-end encrypted"

**Troubleshooting:**
- If messages show "Unable to decrypt" — refresh the page and wait a few seconds. First-time key exchange can take a moment.
- If the lock icon is not visible on hover, check Settings > Security & Privacy > "Show a shield icon for verified messages" (may be in advanced settings).
- If the custom theme is not applied, manually select it in Settings > Appearance.
  </action>
  <verify>
Human reports pass/fail for each requirement:
- VERIFY-01: Admin login
- VERIFY-02: Space and rooms visible
- VERIFY-03: E2EE messaging between two users
- VERIFY-04: Branding (name, theme, logo)
  </verify>
  <done>All four VERIFY requirements confirmed by human observation in a real browser. Type "approved" if all pass, or describe what failed.</done>
</task>

Human confirms all four VERIFY requirements pass via browser testing.

<success_criteria>
Phase 3 is complete when the human confirms:
1. Admin login works at `http://<EC2-hostname>` (VERIFY-01)
2. Default Space and 6 rooms visible in sidebar (VERIFY-02)
3. Two users exchanged E2EE messages with lock icon visible (VERIFY-03)
4. Element Web shows custom brand, theme, and logo (VERIFY-04)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-deploy-and-validate/03-03-SUMMARY.md`
